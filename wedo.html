							<li><b>Execution:</b> Every single successful event has a mission and a primary purpose that is accompanied by objectives and goals. Success of an event is measured by the fulfilment of these goals.</li>
							<li><b>Output Evaluation:</b> People who are attending any special event should enjoy themselves and should also enjoy the various and different aspects of the event. At a basic level, events are judged simply by getting the show on the road and the size of the crowd that turns up. However, at a management level, the success of events are measured in more strategic terms that are input, output and outcome. At Events360 – Design & Management we thoroughly plan the strategy for the positive output of the event as well as the brands.</li>
